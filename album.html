          <p>Hi, Maykie!
Itâ€™s me, Zyrus.</p>
          <p>I know this might be a little unexpected, but donâ€™t worryâ€”this wonâ€™t take long.</p>
          <p>I made this little website just for you.</p>
          <p>This is just my way of saying something Iâ€™ve been meaning to say properly.</p>
          <p>Remember the first message I sent you? That was rushedâ€”I was nervous, and honestly, I felt like I couldâ€™ve said so much more, and it was my friend that sent the message I made since i was so nervous lol.</p>
          <p>So here it is.</p>
          <p>Just give me a few minutes of your time, and I hope this makes you smile, even just a little.</p>
          <p>Thank you!!</p>
